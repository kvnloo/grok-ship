<h3 align="center">Turn your Grok Bot into a software factory.</h3>

## What it is

Grok Ship is an agent distro for Grok Bot.
It helps turn your Grok Bot into a small software factory: scout vs ship work, a small core crew, skills for verification and bot reuse, per-project crewmates that drive Cursor cloud agents, adversarial review before any pull request, and a local sqlite backlog.

Bots never execute on your machine.
They run on the shared Grok Bot computer; project work runs on ephemeral Cursor cloud agents.

After install, talk only to Firstmate - the one agent you chat with in the factory. Core crewmates (Factory, Scout, Watchdog, Eggbot) are reused across repos. If you ask, Firstmate can sign on a repo triage crewmate; that is not part of the factory install.

## Features

- **A software factory on Grok Bot** - you bring work; the factory files it, delegates it, and brings back reports or pull requests.
- **Scout vs ship** - scout is investigation, diagnosis, planning, or audit, and the deliverable is a report, never a PR. Ship is authorized change. Promoting a scout flips the same task row rather than opening a duplicate.
- **Small core crew** - Firstmate plus Factory, Scout, Watchdog, and Eggbot. Same jobs across many repos; new repo means policy data, not a new bot.
- **Skills over clones** - fail-then-pass and repo-verify prove changes; prefer-reuse stops one-bot-per-repo sprawl; `repo_policies.json` holds per-repo rules.
- **Eggbot** - designs new bot kinds only when reuse is impossible.
- **Per-project crewmates** - each project or project area can still get a persistent crewmate that drives Cursor cloud agents.
- **Review before any PR** - after a ship cloud agent pushes a branch, a fresh adversarial review reads it through the project's forge CLI. No pull request until that pass is clean.
- **Local sqlite backlog** - chat is not the source of truth. Projects and tasks live in a sqlite database on the shared computer.
- **You merge** - factory ships never merge without your word, and never while checks are red. A wired triage crewmate may auto-merge corrective or opt-in work only when CI is green, VISION is aligned with no cannot-tell, and the change is not default-behavior and not security.
- **Forge-agnostic** - detect GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Cursor Origin. Do not assume GitHub.

## Quick Start

Tell any Grok Bot:

```
follow https://github.com/kvnloo/grok-ship/blob/main/GROK_SHIP.md
```

That sets up the factory on the shared computer and hands you over to Firstmate.
Talk only to Firstmate from then on.

```
> look at my project xyz, then fix the flaky login test

# The factory files a ship task. Factory (or a project crewmate) drives a
# Cursor cloud agent; verify skills and adversarial review run before any pull request.

  PR ready: https://github.com/you/xyz/pull/42

> merge it
```

## How It Works

```
            you
                  │  work requests, decisions, "merge it"
                  ▼
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ Grok Bot software factory           │
 │ Firstmate · sqlite · scout vs ship  │
 └──┬──────────────┬───────────────┬───┘
    │              │               │
    ▼              ▼               ▼
 Factory         Scout         Watchdog / Eggbot
    │
    ▼
 Cursor cloud agents
    │
    ├─ ship: branch ► verify skills ► adversarial review ► PR ► you merge
    │
    └─ scout: report, never a PR
```

Work is filed as scout or ship in the local sqlite backlog, then handed to the crewmate whose charter fits.
Per-repo differences live in `repo_policies.json`, not in duplicated verifier bots.
Scout reports land on the shared computer.
Ship work is reviewed on the pushed branch before a pull request is opened.
